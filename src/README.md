# Env-JavaScript

## Tips
1. node version should >= 10.3, some modules need nodejs new feature
2. pay attention to the config.json and all `process.env` parameters, maybe your test need to change it first

### Release

v1.0: the image has basic functions, which can connection with mesh control plane and call other function.
